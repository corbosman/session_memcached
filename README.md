session_memcached
=================

PHP ships with two possible options for memcache support, php-memcache and php-memcached. 
The first is supported by roundcube out of the box. This plugin adds php-memcached session support to Roundcube.
This plugin is meant as an example to show how you can write a plugin to add session storage support. 

php-memcache  - http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php

php-memcached - http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php

To modify config options, copy the config.inc.php-dist to config.inc.php and edit the options.
